📚 Introduction to Git and Basic HTML Project

📝 Project Description

This project showcases the skills I have developed in using Git and basic HTML. Throughout the project, I've demonstrated my understanding of file management, essential Git commands, and creating HTML documents with fundamental tags.

💡 Skills Demonstrated

Using Git 🛠️:

Initializing a repository.
Making commits.
Creating and managing branches.
Using git pull and git push to sync changes with a remote repository.
Resolving merge conflicts.
File Management 📂:

Creating, editing, and deleting files and directories.
Viewing the history of changes in files.
Using .gitignore to manage files that should not be tracked.
Basic HTML 🌐:

Structuring HTML documents.
Using key tags like `<div>, <p>, <a>, <img>, and <header>.`
Creating basic lists, tables, and forms.
This project provides a solid foundation for further development in full-stack programming, and I'm excited to apply these skills in more advanced projects. 🚀

Go,go,go!
